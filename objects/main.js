// An object in TypeScript is a collection of properties, where each property has a name (or key) and a value. Objects can be used to group related data and functionality together.
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York" // Additional property
};
// Assign the object to a variable of type Person
const myPerson = person;
// NESTED OBJECTS
// DUCK TYPING
// Duck typing is a concept closely related to structural typing. The principle is "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck." In other words, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the actual type of the object.
